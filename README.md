# Rubix::Api
Ruby wrapper for Rubix api.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rubix-api'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rubix-api

## Usage

First you need to require the gem and you initialize the client by instantiating the Rubix class. To do this you need your _access token_ and you can **optionally** specify _api version_ and _domain_.  

    require 'rubix-api'
    
    client = Rubix.new(access_token, version, domain) # Version and domain are optional

To list categories.
    client.list_categories

To list patterns you need to pass _page_number_ as the only parameter.

    client.list_patterns(2) #where "2" means the page number

To delete patterns you need to pass the pattern_id as the only parameter.

    client.delete_pattern(100) #where "100" means the pattern_id
    
To add a matching pattern you need to pass the _file_ itself or an _file url_ for it, a _label_, and the _category name_ to which the pattern belongs. 

    client.add_pattern({file: FIle, remote_file_url: "http://example.com/path/to/scene", label: 'uid', category_name: 'matching'})
    
To use feature matching, a file or file url is needed, as well as a minimum ratio and a minimum matches amount. 
  
    client.feature_matching({file, remote_file_url, mr: 0.9, mma: 150}) 

For OCR, Rubix needs the path to image or the file itself, and optionally, the area to be scanned.

    client.ocr({file, remote_file_url, rectangles: [[x1,y1.x2,y2],..,[x1,y1,x2,y2]]}
